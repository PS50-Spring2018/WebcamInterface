Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down

There once was a penguin named Bob. The penguin had a friend named Sam. 
They went to school together. 

Bob's and Sam's lives got flipped upside down because it started snowing. 
They built a snowman and played in the snow. But then they got cold. 

Sam was a turtle and got stuck in the snow, oh no!
